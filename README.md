*Alright, let's dive into the most exciting project of all - me! Firstly, I am a child of God, blessed with grace through Jesus Christ. This profound belief fuels my journey with an unwavering enthusiasm. Currently, I'm embarking on a thrilling new venture - delving into the world of programming, specifically through a Java bootcamp, courtesy of a scholarship granted by Santander. Hailing from the Dominican Republic, I've called Brazil home for over three enriching years.*

My core strengths lie in meticulous attention to detail, unwavering integrity, and a steadfast commitment to excellence. I excel in fostering meaningful client relationships, adeptly managing customer interactions, and consistently delivering stellar performance measured by key metrics (KPIs). My versatility across various support channels further amplifies my capabilities, positioning me as a valuable asset poised to drive success for any forward-thinking company.*

*In addition, I am a certified electrical technician, adding another layer of expertise to my skill set.*

*In essence, I'm ready to channel my diverse experiences and unwavering dedication into making a meaningful impact wherever I go.*
